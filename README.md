# Udacity-Capstone-PJ
This repository is dedicated to my capstone project of the Data Scientist Nanogram Degree from Udacity.
In this project, I will analyze the customer behavior data from Starbucks and find some insights related to the data hiding customers.

### Instalation <a name="installation"></a>
The code is saved in .ipynb file and can be run with any tool that support this file format.
The notebook uses only basic data libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

### Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
While exploring the Starbucks dataset, I tried a different method of dealing with missing data.\ 
Noticing that some of the customer demographic data was missing. I classified them into a "High Security" group (contain customers that refused to reveal personal information) and compared them with the other group called "Low Security".\
The questions that I want to answer are:
- Are there any difference in purchase volume between 2 groups?
- Are there any difference in offer responsiveness between 2 groups?
And from there, I proposed some suggestions for business improvement.

### File Description <a name="file"></a>
Data cleaning and analysis can be found in the notebook and the data that I used for this exercise can also be found in this repository.

### Results <a name="results"></a>
The findings of this project has been published [here](https://mainguyenudacity.wordpress.com/2022/01/07/starbucks-understand-the-hiding-customers/).\ 
You can also find my notes on the project limitation and future research recommendation in the notebook.

### Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>
